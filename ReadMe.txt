#About
	- I have used a bunch of small spheres to collide with the flag in different directions to make it looks like wind going through the flag(Works better if the flag comes back to it's position)
	- I've set the the button for flag flying away.

##Controls 
	 - There are camera controls for the user.
	 - W,A,S,D,Q,E for camera movement
	 - Mouse movement for camera rotation
	 - Ctrl + Z /Ctrl + X to change models 
	 - Ctrl + B for wireframe mode
	 - Spacebar to pause and resume mouse mouvement(be default it is set to pause)
	 - UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT to make wind in different directions 
	 - B to make flag fly away
